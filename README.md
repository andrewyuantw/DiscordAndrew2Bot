# DiscordAndrew2Bot

### About

This was a bot I made for a Discord server that my friend group uses to stay connected during the COVID19 pandemic. Because of the frequent use of Discord within our group, I decided to make a bot that would troll my friends, but also include some nice functionalities that would be useful to help us all stay connected within a pandemic.

### Functionalities

* The bot reacts with custom messages when someone mentions a friend in the chat
* The bot plays meme or in-joke clips in an audio channel with certain commands
* The bot is able to select a random message from a channel and send it to the chat
* The bot is also able to select a random person from a voice channel
* The latter two functionalities can be used to ease the workflow if we wish to play Truth or Dare online with a predetermined list of questions
