# DiscordAndrew2Bot

This was a bot I made for a Discord server that my friend group uses to stay connected during the COVID19 pandemic.

The bot reacts with custom messages when someone mentions a friend in the chat, and also plays meme or in-joke clips in an audio channel with certain commands.
The bot also has the functionality to select a random message from a channel and also select a random person from a voice channel.
Our group can use this function to play the quarantine version of Truth or Dare - Truth or Truth - by using !randommessage to get a random Truth question, and !voice to get a random person to answer.
